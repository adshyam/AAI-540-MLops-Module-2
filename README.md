# AAI-540-MLops-Module-2

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for data processing and analysis using AWS services, including S3, Athena, and the AWS Data Wrangler library. The primary focus is on handling and querying data effectively in a cloud environment, making the process scalable and efficient.

# Key Features
Data Cleaning: Standardize and clean the input data to ensure high-quality analytics.
Environment Setup: Configure the necessary cloud services and tools to handle the data processing tasks.
Data Storage with AWS S3: Utilize Amazon S3 for reliable and scalable storage of cleaned data.
Database Creation with AWS Athena: Set up an Athena database to facilitate complex SQL queries on stored data.
Integration and Querying: Implement AWS Data Wrangler to interact seamlessly between S3 and Athena, enhancing the querying capabilities.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
AWS account with access to S3, Athena, and IAM permissions.
Python environment with libraries including AWS Data Wrangler, Pandas, etc.
Basic knowledge of SQL and Python.

# Setup and Configuration
## 1.Environment Setup:

Set up your Python environment with necessary libraries (aws-wrangler, pandas, etc.).
Configure AWS CLI with appropriate credentials and default settings.

## 2.Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Clean the data using Pandas to ensure it is in the required format for analysis.
Save the cleaned data as CSV files.

## 3.S3 Bucket Configuration:

Create an S3 bucket through the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI.
Upload the cleaned CSV data to the S3 bucket.

## 4.Athena Database Setup:

Create an Athena database to manage the data.
Register the S3 bucket with Athena as a data source.

## 5.Querying Data:

Use AWS Data Wrangler within a Python environment to execute SQL queries on the data stored in Athena.
